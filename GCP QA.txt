see stackdriver logs for user activity on bucket
in one stackdriver account we can add all projects
signed url for limited time access to external company
appengine application does not need explicit pubsub role
billing manager can create billing account
verify iam roles under roles section in project
service account maybe global but roles are specific to project
if app engine is serving for one region and want to switch different region. create new, old can not do it

bigquery jobuser role to perform quries
if gKE containe sending more logs disable logs for GKE continer lavel itself
perform rolling-action start-update maxsurge=1 maxunavilable=0
