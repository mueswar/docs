		above code throws expection. Since the enhanced for loop uses an Iterator internally to traverse elements in a Collection, 
		running the above code causes a ConcurrentModificationException since the remove() method of the Collection is used instead of the iterator

Srping answers
----------------------
1. Basic annotations
	@SpringBootApplication  - it triggers component scanning and auto-configuration
	@EnableFeignClients
	@RestController
	@ReuestMapping   - at class level 
	@GetMapping
	@PostMapping
	@PutMapping
	@RequestBody
	@PathVariable
	@RequestParam
	@Component
	@Service
	@Repository
	
2 12 factor
	it is just 12 best practices,
	1.Code version  - git
	2.Dependencies  - pom.xml, build.gradle
	3.configurations -
	4.logs
	5.build
	6.Backing services
	
3. Bean scopes in v6
	singleton (default- only one instance per IoC)
	prototype
	request, session, application, websocket
4. spring-boot-actuator
	it gives production ready features like healt, metrics
	actuator provides dependency managment and auto-configuration for Micrometer Tracing.
	Spring boot ships acuto-configuration for Zipkin tracer

7. The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will 	
	always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource
	multiple times.

Finctional interface
	Funtional interface can have only one abstract method but many default methods and static methods.
	Lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface. Before Java 8, we had to create anonymous inner class objects or implement these interfaces.
Functional programming
	Improved Code Reusability and Modularity
		By following a declarative style, functional programming allows developers to focus on what needs to be done rather than how it should be done. 
		Complex logic can be broken down into small, reusable functions with functional programming, making it easier to test and debug.
	Better Scalability and Performance Optimization
		functional programming enables the composition of functions, where the output of one function becomes the input of another. This composability further enhances code modularity, making reasoning about and maintaining complex software systems easier.
	Reduced Complexity and Improved Debugging
		the immutability of data ensures that functions can be safely executed in parallel without the need for complex synchronization mechanisms.
		functional programming encourages the use of lazy evaluation, where computations are only performed when their results are actually needed.
callable
	Java 5 introduced java.util.concurrent.Callable interface in concurrency package that is similar to Runnable interface but it can return any Object and able to throw Exception.
	Callable interface has call method
	We can exicute callable with ExecutorService.submit, submit returns Future.
	when we submit main thread does not get blocked , main thread continue to exicute state ments after submit method 
	we have Feature.get method to get callable return object.
	When we call Feature.get method main thread gets blocked until callable completes task and returns value
	feature.get()
	feature.get(time)//it avoid getting blocked for longer
	feature.isDone() and isCancelled()  // to know the status of callable
Exicutors
	By providing a simple and efficient way to manage task execution, the Executor Framework can help developers improve the performance and scalability of their applications while minimizing the risk of threading errors and other concurrency issues.
	The framework includes several key components, including the Executor, ExecutorService, ScheduledExecutorService, and ThreadPoolExecutor. 
	An Executor is normally used instead of explicitly creating threads. generally to run runnable task we have to create thred using new Thread passing runnable task and we call start method. But with Executor we call execute method.
	Executor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(1, 10,0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>());
	executor.execute(runnableTask);
	ExecutorService is an extended version of Executor with more methods and features.
	An ExecutorService provides methods to manage termination and methods that can produce a Future for tracking the progress of one or more asynchronous tasks.
	When an ExecutorService is terminated then it has no tasks actively executing, no tasks waiting for execution, and no new tasks can be submitted.
	Hence an unused ExecutorService should be shut down to allow the reclamation of its resources.
	ExecutorService has methods like submit(), invokeAny, invokeAll.
	The ThreadPoolExecutor is an implementation of ExecutorService and provides a pool of threads that executes the runnable or callable tasks.
	ExecutorService executorService = new ThreadPoolExecutor(1, 10,0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>());
	We also have Executors class
	ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
CompleatableFeature vs Feature
	CompletableFuture(java 8) is non blocking
		it is easy to combile multiple async calls
		thenApply(), thenAccept(), join(), thenCompose(), thenCombine(), and allOf()
	Feature(java 5) is blocking feature
		get() -it blocks
