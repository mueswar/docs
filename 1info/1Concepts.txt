to iterate list, we do not need to call stream method, we can directly call forEach method on list instance.
list.stream().filter(a -> a.name().length()<20).foreach(System.out::println);
here filter is lazy method , it will not exicute until we hit terminal operation forEach

how get sum of emps age with reduce function 
	list.stream().map(Emp::getAge).reduce(0,(total,age) -> total+age);
what is functional programming? it is higher order funationality ,immutability, but other important thigs is functional composition and lazy evaluvation.

lazy evaluvation requires purity of function.
pure function gives same output if we give same input as many times we call it.
pure function does not depend on anything that possible change


Asynchronous Programming in Java: Options to Choose from By Venkat Subramaniam  2:3921 10/2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java 1.0 Threads
java 5.0 Executors
java 7 ForkJoin
java 8 parallel streams and CompletableFuture

generally threads will be blocked and wait for something, to solve we create more threads.
but that is not good idea

callbacks - callbacks also have drabacks and nested callbacks create even more problems

promises- 

He will explain CompletableFuture with java script
