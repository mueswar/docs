IAM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when we creat user, adminstator can give two kids of access types 1. programmatics and 2. console access
we only get access key and secrect key for programmatics access type user

create group and add policy(existing policy like s3 full access)
create user and add user to group, now user can have access to S3

Roles will be assigned to applications not for user.
while creating role we should select role type(ec2/lambda) and attach policy/role(s3 full access)
now we can attach this role to ec2 and then ec2 can access s3

we can also create custom policy

IAM fedaration 
Identity fedaration uses SAML standard (Active directory)

when we login with root accot 
step1:set MFA security
step2:create user 
step3:add permission (i.e attach policy) like AdministratorAccess/IAMUserPasswordChange
step4: create group and attach policy like AdministratorAccess
step5: add user to group

Login with IAM user
create EC2
step1- select AMI(linex2 free tire)
step2- select instance type t2 micro 1 cpu 1 GB memory
step3- no of instance
	   vpc (there will be one default vpc)
	   subnet
	   public ip
	   purchage option (spot instance, on demand) do not selct any by default it is on demand
	   Enable cloudwatch logs (do not do it for frist time)
	   create tags (name: myfirst instance)
step4- create security group
	   Type-SSH protocol:TCP
step5- create key pair to login to EC2 machine

SSH doe not work for befoure windows 10 versions
PUTTY (SSH util) can be used for older windows systems
EC2 instance connect (tool to connect to EC2)
C:>chmod 0400 keyFilename
c:>ssh -i keyFilename ec2-user@pulic ip of ec2
[ec2-user@100.33.44.22]$whoami
to exit ctrl+C

to connect with ec2 instance connect, login to aws account>select ec2 instance>connect> provide user name
here no key pair is required

everytime we stop ec2 we will loose public ip and private ip does not change

Vertical scalability: increase size of instance (t2 small to t2 large)
Harizontal scalability: increase no of instances

High Availability: running same application in multiple AZ's

ELB
-------------------------------------------------
with ELB we can provide single point of access(DNS) to your application
does regular health checks on instances
hides failures of down stream systems 
spred load acorss multiple down stream systems
classic load balancer 2009 (Http, Https, TCP)
Application load balancer 2016 (Http, Https, websoket)
network load balancer 2017 (TCP, TLS and UDP)

Private and public load balancer

CLB-
create- load balancer>CLB>
	select internal or external load balancer
	listener config- choose http 80 (i.e accepect request from http/80) 
	and also select instance ()how it conncets with instance
	create new security group> tcp/80 0.0.0.0 (i.e anyone on port 80 from anywhere(ip address))
	create health check> path can be given as root(/) and itervel as 30 seconds, 
	intervel shouls be more than response time
	add already created EC2 to load balancer
	now CLB is ready take DNS and hit in browser for testing
	if ec2 security allows request from anywhere then we can access Ec2 we can hit ec2 public ip 
	directly or we can access with load balancer
	if we edit ec2 security gruop to aloow only from load balancer then we can only access from CLB
	
NLB
	high performance compare to ALB (100ms latency for NLB almost 4 times less than ALB)
	
VPC
-------------------------------------------------
one VPC can not span multiple regions
subnet can not span multiple avilability zones

Internet gateway
-------------------------------------------------
we can attach and detach IGW with VPC
one IGW connects to one VPC only

Route table
-------------------------------------------------
you can have multiple route tables in one VPC
one route table can have multiple subnets
if can delete route table when there are no subnets to that route table

Subnets
----------------
one  subnet will be availabe in one Zone.
one subnet connect(associates) to one route table
private subnet conects to rout tables but not internet gateway
public subnet conects to rout tables and internet gateway

S3 simple storage service
--------------------------
Standard  durability(99.99999999) availability(99.99)
Reduced redundancy storage  durability(99.99) availability(99.99)
infrequent access durability(99.99999999) availability(99.90)
Glaceir  durability(99.99999999) 
S3:lifecycle: you can automate storage class duration.
S3:versioning
by default versioning is disabled
we can suspend versioning anytime but that does not delete old verions

Elastic compute cloud (Ec2)
--------------------------------------
on-demand: more expensive
reserved:
spot
Amazon Machine Image (AMI's)

***************************************************************************************************
											Lamda
***************************************************************************************************
Open lambda console>functions
crete lambda
crate role(we can edit in permission tab later, like add lambda sqs access)

invoke lambda with CLI/ALB/API gateway --syncronus invocation
create lambda by just providing name and selecting new role with basic permission 
create ALB and chouse Lamda as traget group
invoke ALB from browser with DNS name

invoke lambda with cloudwatch event bridge/S3 notification-- asyncronus invocation
create lambda by just providing name and selecting new role with basic permission
create S3 bucket and configure notification event, in this config select lambda fuction

AWS EC2
forum:    https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=30
Elastic Load Balancing: To automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple instances
Amazon CloudWatch: To monitor basic statistics for your instances and Amazon EBS volumes
aws cloudtrail: To monitor the calls made to the Amazon EC2 API for your account, including calls made by the AWS 	
				Management Console, command line tools, and other services
Amazon RDS: To get a managed relational database in the cloud
VM Import/Export: To import virtual machine (VM) images from your local environment into AWS and convert them into 
				ready-to-use AMIs or instances

cloudFormation engine : depolyment service
------------------------------------------
cloudFormation takes templete with stack information leike database, ECS and creates environment.
cloudFormation>stack>design templete : darg and drop components like VPC, Subnet
or use sample templete
it helps in disaster situvations
one templete can call another templete(one for VPC and one Subnet)

ECS(elastic continaer service) : container service
--------------------------------------------------
continer orchestration service from AWS which makes us easy to manage docker continers on EC2
one EC2 OS and then Docker engine and mulpile continers on same engine.
each application in one docker continer
ECS can help us on sclae up application
Docker image is registered with AWS ECR continer registery
there will be task defenation in ECS which docker image should be used, how much memory for docker continer

elastic beankStlak
-------------------
elastic beanStalk help to build environmet and deploy application

what happens if we try to create application with elastic beanStalk
it store application S3 bucket(as source code repository)
it creates security group
it create elastic ip
it launches EC2 instance
it configures helth checks 
it creats url for application

Kinesis
---------------------------------
Producers puts adata in Kinesis and cosumer takes data as stream.
Kinesis can keep data maximum of 7 days
Stream contains one or more shards(1MB/sec data input, 2MB output)
Kinesis Firehose- loads data to S3,Redshift, ElasticSearch, Splunk
Kinesis data analytics- runs SQL against data streams
benifits: realtime processing, parllel processing, Durable, Scales

Elastic MapReduce (EMR): Analytics service
--------------------------------------------
Bigdata frameforks: Hadoop and Spark
Hadoop uses HDFS to store data and data will be in instance, but EMR you can store data in S3
