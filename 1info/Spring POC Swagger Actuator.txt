Actuator(2.x)
------------------------------------------------
Actuator(2.X) is now technology-agnostic whereas in 1.x it was tied to MVC, therefore to the Servlet API.
Unlike in previous versions, Actuator comes with most endpoints disabled.
Thus, the only two available by default are /health and /info.
/env
/health

actuator
actuator/info
actuator/health
