known and legitimate Certificate Authorities (CA)
	Comodo
	DigiCert
	Entrust
production application certificates should be signed by known and legitimate Certificate Authorities (CA).
Springboot does not support PEM Files, we need to convert PEM file into PKCS12 file.
to configure certificate, we need to configure PKCS12 file and key in application.yml
if website accepect HTTPS connection, then browser and server exchange data in encrypted form.
CA verifies organigation and domain names before issing certificates.



Authorization


service to external call
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	call token service passing passing client id and secret
		we can save token since client and secret does not chnage 
		based on token expiration
		it is b2b so client id and secret doenot change
		but in case of user to app, client id(username) changes
	call external API through apigateway
		on apigateway, authorizer will be called passing token
		authorizer(lambda) validates token calling Azure
		on successful call to authorozer, apigateway redirects call to service
		
	how to evict cache for token

Because all will be in same vpc
