	Creational Patterns
		Creational patterns deal with the creation of objects.
			prototype pattern
				create instance with intial setup and create more by cloning when ever required
				every new chese game will have same intial setup
			Builder Pattern
				when we want to create instance with only subset of properties
			Singleton Pattern
			Factory Method Pattern
				based on user input object will be created from family of objects(Men or women)
	Structural Patterns
		Structural patterns deal with the composition of objects.
			proxy pattern
				proxy aboject should work as it acual object(remote object) in local machine
				example: ejb Home and ejb remote
				credit and back account
			Facade pattern
				example event manger(go to person)
				client interact with one service(interface) this service interacts with mulitple sevices and gives what client need
				it reduces network latency
			Adapter pattern
				you interact different system both have different formats but client need always same format
	Behavioral Patterns
		behavior of objects or interactions between objects.



Factory pattern
------------------------------------------
public abstract class Car {
	protected abstract void construct();
}
public class LuxuryCar extends Car { protected void construct() {}}
public class SmallCar extends Car {protected void construct() {} }
public class CarFactory {
    public static Car buildCar(CarType model) {
        Car car = null;
        switch (model) {
        case SMALL:
            car = new SmallCar();
            break;
        }
        return car;
    }
}

DAO
--------------------------------------
interface AgentDao  
{ 
    public List<Agent> getAllAgents(); 
} 
 
class AgentDaoImpl implements AgentDao  
{ 

}
