What is difference between where and having clause
	main difference between WHERE and HAVING clause in SQL is that, condition specified in WHERE clause is used while fetching data (rows) from table, 
	and data which doesn't pass the condition will not be fetched into result set, on the other hand HAVING clause is later used to filter summarized data or grouped data. 
Drop - removes table and index
truncate - total data
delete - we can delete few records

What is Difference between Primary Key and Unique Key in SQL?
Primary and Unique key uniquely identifies each row in table but there are some subtle difference between them. here are some of them :

1) Unique key in a table can be null, at-least one but primary key can not be null in any table in relation database like MySQL , Oracle etc.

2) Primary key can be combination of more than one unique keys in same table.

3) There can be only one primary key per table in relation database e.g. MySQL, Oracle or Sybase but there can be more than one unique key per table.

4) Unique key is represented using unique constraint while primary key is created using primary key constraint in any table and it’s automatically gets unique constraint.

5) Many database engine automatically puts clustered index on primary key and since you can only have one clustered index per table, its not available to any other unique key at same time.

What is Difference between Truncate and Delete command in SQL?
	1.truncate is fast delete is slow.
	2.truncate doesn’t do logging delete logs on per row basis.
	3.rollback is possible with delete not with truncate until specifically supported by the vendor.
	4.truncate doesn’t fire trigger, delete does.
	5.Don’t delete, truncate it when it comes to purge tables.
	6.truncate reset identity column in table if any, delete doesn’t.
	7.truncate is DDL while delete is DML (use this when you are writing exam)
	8.truncate doesn’t support where clause, delete does.

What is difference between UNION vs UNION ALL in SQL?

1) Both UNION and UNION ALL are used to combine result of two separate SQL query, it could be on same table or different table but data should be same. E.g. if product_id is used in two table e.g. Product and Order, then two sql queries which pulls product_id from these two table can be combined using UNION or UNION ALL.

2) Key difference between UNION and UNION ALL is that Union will remove duplicates but Union All will keep them. In another words, UNION is equal to running distinct on output of UNION ALL. For example, if product_id 10 is returned by both of SQL query then it will only appear once if you use UNION and appear twice if you use UNION ALL.

Is it possible for a table to have more than one foreign key? 
	Yes, a table can have many foreign keys and only one primary key.
What is the difference between Having clause and Where clause?
	Both specify a search condition but Having clause is used only with the SELECT statement and typically used with GROUP BY clause.
	If GROUP BY clause is not used then Having behaved like WHERE clause only.
